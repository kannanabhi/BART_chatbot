# BART_chatbot
Implementation of BERT model for FAQ chatbots

## Objective of the project
Simple implementation for 3 different BERT model to demonstrate they can be used for modelling FAQ chatbot in the "english" language

## Steps to run the code

### Spark_nlp_qnaBot.ipynb file
+ we have implemented 3 models by writing simple wrapper code on models published by sparknlp
+ bert_qa_arap_qa_bert_large_v2, bert_qa_arap_qa_bert_v2, bert_qa_arap_qa_bert have been demonstrated in the file
+ our model requires question, context pair and it is able to genearate the answer corresponding to it
+ refer to **Project 2: Arabic Chatbot** in endsem_report.pdf for indept details on the project

## Features of the project
+ simple implementation for demonstarion purposes

## Scope for improvements
+ now a model can be built upon these models using appropriate datasets
